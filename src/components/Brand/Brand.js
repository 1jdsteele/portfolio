          <h3>Brand Statement</h3>
          <p>
          I am passionate about work that can improve the lives of humans and the environments they live within both quantitative and qualitative ways. With increasing technological complexity we have the opportunity to free ourselves from the work we never wanted to do so we can do more of the work that feeds our souls and to make the world a more beautiful place. However  this ever growing power has the ability to disenfranchise, discriminate, divide, and monopolize itself. It is up to the people who develop these tools to ensure that they are used not for evil but rather for righteous causes. 

As one of these people who develop these tools, I hold myself to the highest standard to drive myself and those around me toward a more perfect path. I am beginning a journey in software engineering by learning briefly about technologies from the front to the back to ground myself in fundamentals of a few languages and how these various disparate structures interact to form a cohesive whole. I see myself continuing to expand on various technologies Iâ€™m familiar with as well as diving deeper into several to further my understanding. With these tools I hope to be able to help communities, organizations, and individuals, to create better aspects of humanity.

The limits of our creations are nothing less than our collective imaginations. Working in collaboration  with others brings me joy to discover, create, and maintain projects that are bigger than any individual. I look forward to meeting with anybody to discuss such endeavors.
