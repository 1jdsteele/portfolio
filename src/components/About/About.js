          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Jake, a full stack software engineer looking for a full time job. I have done work for clients in liquid for a Shopify e-commerce store. I've also made games and worked with a group on a different e-commerce store. I have experience with MERN, DjangoDB, and PostgreSQL. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After studying some basics, I rounded out my software education with a immersive software engineering class by General Assembly where I was supported to learn the full stack. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Before software engineering I had turned my art hobby into a small professional career installing murals, creating exhibitions, and painting commisioned portraits. I have won a few awards in the arts, provided original artwork in two group exhibitions, and have had three solo exhibitions. Hopefully I will have another solo exhibition this year!
            <br />
            <br />
            I also have a background in agriculture which I worked in for nine years, doing everything from breaking soil to creating and managing working teams. I still love gardening.
